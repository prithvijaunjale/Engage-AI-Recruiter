NOTES:
	- Coming up with a great list of questions is only the first step in conducting an in-depth interview. It’s the follow-up questions that will really tell you who you’re dealing with"

TYPES of counter/follow-up questions:
	- Ask your original question again, slightly differently.
		e.g. 
		"Let me ask you this another way..."
		"What do you think the biggest risk to our project is?" 
			-> "What do you think the project manager worries about most?"
			-> "Tell me about a time a similar project went wrong.""

	- Connect their answers to each other.
		e.g. "Is that what you meant earlier when you said...?"

	- Ask about the implications of their answer.
		e.g. A: "I’m a perfectionist" | CQ: "How does your perfectionism play out in the workplace?""

	- Ask for elaboration.
		e.g. 
		"Tell me more about that.", 
		"What do you mean by...", 
		"I want to make sure I understand what you said. You said you didn’t have much confidence in the product team. Did I get that right?"
		

OTHER SAMPLES:
	1. What was the most important part of your work?
		I think that dealing with customers was the most important part of my work. I needed to develop a good understanding of the products we sold so I could help customers. I also learned to be polite and keep smiling, even with some of the more challenging shoppers.

	2. How would your friends and colleagues describe you?
	 	I think that I did well on my previous course.  I got on well with other people, and really enjoyed working with them. At the same time, sometimes I had to put my work first, and make sure that I completed what I needed to do. So, I would say that they would describe me as disciplined, but friendly and supportive.

	3. What has your work experience taught you about yourself?
		The last time I worked as a language assistant, I found the work really interesting but sometimes hard. I learned a lot from my work experience. On one occasion I found two boys fighting in the playground. I managed to calm them down by being calm myself. I asked them what had happened and helped them to resolve their fight themselves. I thought that in a situation like that I would get angry myself, and perhaps take sides, but I did not.  I think that this was a great lesson for me.
